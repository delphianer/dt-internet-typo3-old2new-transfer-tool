# Transfer tooling for legacy typo3 pages 

My tiny bit to transfer data from a legacy page (Typo3 Version 6.x) towards a modern one (typo3 10.x). 

My aim is to do as less manually work as possible.

## Requirements

### Setup 

Use Python 11.x or higher, that should do all => use pip for requirements in your venv.

### config

first run creates a basic config with my project settings

Please change them first in main.py if I have no template for you yet :)

# final thoughts

I had fun with an LLM to do that in one evening :)

Have fun, too, to mod it :)
